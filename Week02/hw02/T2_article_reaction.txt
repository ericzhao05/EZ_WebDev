I found this article really helpful in my process of making wireframes. 
It explains important things to remember when making wireframes such as 
labeling buttons and navigation clearly so users understand their purpose 
without extra explanation. It focuses on keeping designs clear, simple, 
and easy for users. One thing that stood out was finding the right amount
of detail. If there is too much detail, it takes longer to make changes 
and can slow things down. But if there is too little detail, people might 
not understand the design clearly. It's important to include just enough 
information so that changes are easy, and the design makes sense to everyone. 
It also made it clear that wireframing helps people work together and share ideas.
