        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Ribeye Steak (0.5-1kg)</em></li>
            <li><em>Salt (to taste)</em></li>
            <li><em>Black Pepper (to taste)</em></li>
            <li><em>Olive Oil (1/2 Teaspoon)</em></li>
            <li><em>Butter (2-3 tablespoons)</em></li>
            <li><em>Garlic (2-3 cloves, smashed or halved)</em></li>
            <li><em>Rosemary (1-2 sprigs)</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove the steak from the fridge <strong>30 minute</strong> 
            before cooking to allow it to reach room temperature. 
            This helps the steak cook evenly.</li>
            <li>Season the steak generously on both sides with 
            salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
            <li>Dry with kitchen paper to remove any excess liquid</li>
            <li>Heat a pan over high heat. 
            Add the olive oil once the pan is hot.</li>
            <li>Once the oil is heated, sear the edges of 
            the steak for <strong>45-60 seconds</strong>  per edge.</li>
            <li>Lay the steak flat in the pan and sear 
            one side for <strong>3-4 minutes</strong> until a golden-brown 
            crust forms. </li>
            <li>Flip the steak and reduce the heat to medium. 
            Add the butter, garlic, and rosemary to the pan.</li>
            <li>Cook the steak until the internal temperature 
            reaches your desired doneness:
              <ul>
                <li>Medium Rare: 145°F</li>
                <li>Medium: 160°F</li>
                <li>Well Done: 170°F</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Remove the steak from the pan and let it rest 
            for <strong>5-8 minutes</strong> before slicing.</li>
        </ol>
