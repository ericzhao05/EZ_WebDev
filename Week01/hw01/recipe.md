# Pan Seared Steak

A classic recipe for a perfectly cooked steak with a golden-brown crust, infused with the rich flavors of butter, garlic, and rosemary. This straightforward method ensures a steak that’s tender, juicy, and full of flavor.

## Ingredients
- Ribeye Steak (0.5-1kg)
- Salt (to taste) 
- Black Pepper (to taste) 
- Olive Oil (1/2 Teaspoon)
- Butter (2–3 tablespoons)
- Garlic (2–3 cloves, smashed or halved) 
- Rosemary (1-2 sprigs)

## Procedure
1. Remove the steak from the fridge 30 minutes before cooking to allow it to reach room temperature. This helps the steak cook evenly.
2. Season the steak generously on both sides with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
3. Dry with kitchen paper to remove any excess liquid
4. Heat a pan over high heat. Add the olive oil once the pan is hot.
5. Once the oil is heated,  sear the edges of the steak for 45–60 seconds per edge.
6. Lay the steak flat in the pan and sear one side for 3–4 minutes until a golden-brown crust forms.
7. Flip the steak and reduce the heat to medium. Add the butter, garlic, and rosemary to the pan.
8. Cook the steak until the internal temperature reaches your desired doneness:
    - Medium Rare (145°F)
    - Medium (160°F)
    - Well Done (170°F)

9. Remove the steak from the pan and let it rest for 5–8 minutes before slicing.
